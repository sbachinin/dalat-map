        title: `Đốc Sơ church`,
        subtitle: `This building was removed around 2023 and replaced by a very different structure shaped like a Vietnamese conical hat. Interestingly, the condition of the old church was not especially bad, and the new church is not any larger than the old one. It seems that the parish (or some larger Catholic organization) simply did not like the design and wanted a more modern (or more patriotic) church. As far as I can tell, this approach is not unusual: Vietnamese Catholic society aspires to keep up with the times, and this means that outdated architectural works are replaced from time to time with something more modern. This process must have begun right after independence, judging by Phu Cam Cathedral - the grandest church in Hue,  demolished in the 1960s, because it certainly did not convey the right message to the people.

        In 2023-2024, there was another small modernization campaign that swept away several more colonial churches within Hue and its vicinity.

        Today, this area still has perhaps 15-20 Catholic colonial churches. My overall impression is that in the mid-20th century, Hue must have had at least 5 times as many. Basically, it was once full of colonial churches - mostly small parish ones, but of great architectural quality and diversity.
        I also suspect that at least a half of all the modern churches seen today in this area must have french predecessors.`,

        church`,

        title: `Ngọc Hồ
        church`,
        subtitle: `In 2021, this church was extended by adding a bell tower, making it overall at least twice as tall. For this reason, I cannot classify it as a colonial building.

        However, it must be said that this church is rather fortunate—it was not replaced by something entirely new, and the new bell tower is not entirely bad; for a moment, I thought it was an original one.

        The location is said to be quite pretty and tranquil, so I think it can be recommended for a visit.`,

Interestingly enough, it seems that the motive for demolition was simply cutting the maintenance costs rather than development projects (by 2025 nothing new was built on the site). It was too old for profitable commercial use but had to maintain a polished look in order not to ruin the grand view of the adjacent Hue Heritage hotel - a hopeless arrangement indeed.`,

Later it became a regular vietnamese school but retained a remarkably antiquated look until the sweeping demolition in 2022. Besides the chapel, there stood 2 or 3 colonial classroom buildings with an arcade passage connecting them. In 2025 the campus was newly opened with a totally different arrangement of buildings and no trace of anything historical.`,
