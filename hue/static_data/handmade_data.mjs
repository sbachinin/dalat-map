        It's not included in Unesco's "Complex of Hue monuments" and it takes a brief moment to understand why is that.
        This palace is one of the most opulent structures built in Hue by the Nguyen dynasty.
        As a piece of architecture it's comparable to Khai Dinh tomb, also a very european structure and also outside the Hue Citadel - but of course european to a lesser degree.
        The borderline of being Unesco-important is perhaps a bit blurry in Hue. An Dinh Palace indeed must fall short of having an "Outstanding Universal Value", being mostly an exercise in european architecture, however successful it is, and not being sufficiently unique`,

Shortly afterwads all colonial structures were demolished, and in 2025 the campus was newly opened with no trace of anything historical.`

Interestingly enough, it seems that the motive for demolition was simply cutting the maintenance costs rather than development projects (by 2025 nothing new was built on the site). It was too old for profitable commercial use but had to maintain a polished look in order not to ruin the grand view of the adjacent Hue Heritage hotel - a hopeless arrangement indeed."

        title: 'Thien Dinh Palace',
        subtitle: `This is the main structure of Khai Dinh tomb complex. It's basically a baroque palace (rather small one) with a vietnamese roof shape and ornaments - a rather audacious fusion that, in my view, works exceptionally well. Its construction took 11 years and ended in 1931. The king Khai Dinh was know for his French tendencies and was ridiculed a "paid employee of the French state", so it's no surprise that this Palace turned out so european, breaking with a long architectural tradition of vietnamese imperial tombs. This building is included in Unesco-protected complex of Hue monuments together with several other imperial tombs. One obvious architectural counterpart of this building is Kien Trung Palace of Hue Imperial city - also a european palace with vietnamese finish, although significantly larger and perhaps less ambitious in its architectural features (Its construction began almost simultaneously with Khai Dinh tomb but was completed much faster, in 1923).`,

It's a common feature of all royal tombs of Nguyen dynasty, always  standing in the center of the tomb complex. This pavilion, like the quaint palace above it, breaks many architectural traditions of vietnamese imperial tombs by including some european features: arched openings, romanesque columns and octagonal plan (instead of traditionally rectangular). Carvings depict some national motives but their style is rather western - less geometric and more ornate.`
