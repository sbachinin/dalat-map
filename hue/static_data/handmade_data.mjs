        subtitle: `This residential complex neither belongs to the colonial era nor is it a recognized architectural landmark. Still I can't resist including it in the "colonial highlights" of Hue because, first of all, this complex is a sheer architectural delight, and secondly, it's a very foreign piece of architecture, introduced by a very different civilization - soviet in this case. 

        It  looks totally out of place in this featureless suburb, next to the busy and very casual street market. Against this backdrop it look almost opulent. It also carries a faint french feel - thought it's unlikely that any french architectural forces were involved in this project. 
        
        I guess it was built around 1960s or 70s - judging by its similarity to Hanoi's "Community houses" (Nha Tap The), which were also built during the early post-independence period. It's essentially a very soviet project, with 3 identical bulky builidings, 4 storeys height, without much decoration but well-considered proportions and a non-linear layout. Overall, there’s a lot to appreciate here for anyone interested in architecture. All the chaotic additions and enhancements introduced by the tenants don't destroy the architecture but only add more character to it.`

By 1972, the church was mostly restored, but still lacked the bell tower. Photos from that time show an incomplete but really beautiful version of the building. In 2008, a full restoration was completed — as far as I can tell, the original design was followed, but without much scrutiny. Some minor simplifications sneaked in, and most notably, the bell tower became thinner, which really ruined the overall proportions. (The most reliable part is the ground-floor arcade that wasn't destroyed in the war). Also — traditionally for churches in Hue — the paint was chosen very poorly. As a result, today the building doesn’t look colonial at all (and perhaps that wasn’t the goal of the restoration). It’s not the worst church in Hue, but I hesitate to consider it a historical building.`,

        It's not included in Unesco's "Complex of Hue monuments" and it takes a brief moment to understand why is that.
        This palace is one of the most opulent structures built in Hue by the Nguyen dynasty.
        As a piece of architecture it's comparable to Khai Dinh tomb, also a very european structure and also outside the Hue Citadel - but of course european to a lesser degree.
        The borderline of being Unesco-important is perhaps a bit blurry in Hue. An Dinh Palace indeed must fall short of having an "Outstanding Universal Value", being mostly an exercise in european architecture, however successful it is, and not being sufficiently unique`,

However, I bet this is a brand new building, looking at how similar it is to both lateral blocks of Hai Ba Trung school campus, - it's identical in architecture but shorter. Such uniformity seems to be a little strange for a french colonial project like this. But, regradless of its authenticity, this building in itself looks great and convincingly colonial.`

Its construction took 11 years and ended in 1931. The king Khai Dinh was know for his French tendencies and was ridiculed a "paid employee of the French state", so it's no surprise that this Palace turned out so european, breaking with a long architectural tradition of vietnamese imperial tombs.
        This building is included in Unesco-protected complex of Hue monuments together with several other imperial tombs. One obvious architectural counterpart of this building is Kien Trung Palace of Hue Imperial city - also a european palace with vietnamese finish, although significantly larger and perhaps less ambitious in its architectural features (Its construction began almost simultaneously with Khai Dinh tomb but was completed much faster, in 1923).`,

Unreliable sources on the web suggest that it once belonged to a Christian orphanage that operated until 1975. (The orphanage was recently restored, but at a different nearby location.)

        I also think it could be somehow related to the Saint-Sulpice "major" seminary, built during colonial times about 300 meters to the east along the Perfume River. My reason for thinking so is based on old photographs of a strikingly similar chapel that once stood (but no longer does) in the nearby city of Quang Tri and served as the chapel of a "minor" seminary.

        Thanks to its ambiguous status, this building is perhaps the only church in Hue that has escaped the modern Disney-style renovations and wasn't painted in some nasty colors. Instead, it's delightfully half-ruined, and the choice of paint feels quite appropriate for a colonial-era structure.

        There are also many visual similarities between this building and the chapel of the adjacent Carmelite monastery — but the meaning of those similarities is another mystery.`,

That may be true in some sense, but as a piece of architecture, it's difficult to regard it as colonial — based on how it looks today and also on its history (which is a bit obscure). In the early 20th century, it was a rather small building that had nothing in common with the current one, except its main spatial layout with a chamfered corner — i.e., the original hotel also made this double 45° turn at the street corner, instead of a right angle.

Before the end of the French protectorate period, it was extended several times, by 1953 having (supposedly) 72 rooms. Unfortunately, I failed to find any imagery depicting these intermediate stages of its development, so it's hard to say how it looked by the end of French rule.

During the wars and long afterward, it was in serious decline and stopped being a hotel for a while, serving instead as one of the buildings of Hue University. Then in the 1990s, it was decided to revive it as a hotel and to make it bigger and better than it ever was. Today it has 180 bedrooms and - I'm guessing - mostly new architecture that is loosely based on some colonial prototype. It looks indeed much more colonial than most other hotels in Hue, but still not quite colonial enough. I guess the oldest thing it retains today is, again, its spatial layout — an enclosed “fortress” occupying a whole block, with an extensive inner courtyard where hotel guests are well protected from the street life.`
