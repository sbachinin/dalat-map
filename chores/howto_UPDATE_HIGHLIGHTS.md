Download highlights to the project from Google Photos
Preferably, highlights should be added to some "normal" arch album
    and downloaded as part of it, to avoid downloading files twice.
Retrieve order of highlights (see chores/howto_retrieve_order_of_highlights.js)
Check that highlights_order is correct: at least that it's as long as the number of images in Google Photos album
Validate:
    run build_city with validate images flag true, check for such errors
