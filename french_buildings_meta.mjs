        descr: `One of the 3 palaces of king Bao Dai. (All 3 in Dalat).
This on was built in 1933-1937.
Now it's possibly used as an event space by some bosses of Lam Dong province.
The building is massive and rather clumsy and bureaucratic to my taste. One explanation of this is that Palace II was designed as headquarters of the French ruling apparatus in Indochina. (Though this fact comes from a dubious source in the web).
However clumsiness is redeemed by the setting: a vast pine forest on the very top of the hill. A really tranquil and enigmatic place.
The palace is well maintained but still shows a bit of historical shabbiness which is nice. At the time of my visit the surrounding area was completely deserted.
Access seems to be unrestricted, I just walked through the entrance from the south. (Not from main street).`

        I entered the campus without a problem. The building stands next to an old pine grove.`
