        title: 'Stadthuys\n(Dutch city hall)',
        subtitle: `It was built by the Dutch in 1650 as a governor's office. Later it served many other functions, and today it is a house of the History and Ethnography Museum.
It is promoted as the oldest remaining Dutch building in Southeast Asia — a claim that is actually not supported by historical evidence. It's only known that it was built shortly after Malacca was captured by the Dutch in 1641. It was built exactly where the Portuguese governor’s house used to be — destroyed during the Dutch victorious attack on Malacca. (The fighting was fierce.)
Stadthuys was an architectural copy of the town hall of Hoorn in the Netherlands.
The most interesting question for me is the color of the building. Why is Stadthuys, and all the surrounding buildings, painted in this awful red (or crimson, or brown) color? In Dutch times, Stadthuys was painted WHITE, and began to be painted red only under British rule around 1900. There are many versions of why it was done so, but I guess that was certainly not a question of beauty. The most plausible explanation is that white paint was expensive to maintain: the underlying brickwork is red, and after being uncovered by tropical rains, it all looked not very satisfactory. Switching to red paint just allowed it to be painted less often.
Today the concept of "Red Square" of Melakka is an important part of the local tourist industry, so I guess the question of color must be settled once and forever. Which is a little tragic - not only this brown hue is bad, bad also the lack of color variation basically ruins the view.

        title: 'Ruin with murals',


        subtitle: `I actually don't possess any valuable information about this building, but I think it's gorgeous. It looks like someone's fancy art project, in a way. Why? Because it's the only ruin in central Malacca that is explicitly open to the public and maintained by someone – meaning that someone keeps it relatively clean but without trying to make it look new. Which is a very good kind of maintenance, I think.

        I'm also curious about its preservation status: it's carefully excluded from UNESCO's "core" heritage area – the border is drawn precisely to include all the neighboring buildings but not this particular one. It must be some legal thing; I've no idea why it is so. But being outside this "core" area certainly makes it more likely for a building to be a ruin – and ruins are cool, so we shouldn't complain.

        Another thing that puzzles me is that this building has some free space around it – it's not directly connected to any other building, which in central Malacca must have been an extraordinary waste of land. I can't remember any other such examples, because even the richest houses here are squashed by the adjacent buildings.`

A photograph from the '20s shows a building of about the same size but with simpler architecture — without a Dutch gable, without an arcade, and with much fewer windows. And of course, it wasn’t red (and perhaps none of the buildings of the Red Square were red).
        So this last reconstruction must have been a radical one.
        It’s quite admirable that the British bothered to reproduce the style of their colonial predecessors. If it was actually an attempt to make the 'Red Square' more architecturally coherent, then it wasn't a complete disaster. Today, this building looks mostly organic in its context.

        Strictly speaking, there is another surviving section of the fortress: the Middelburg Bastion, located next to the Stadthuys, restored quite recently, its only original part being the foundation.
        Porta, by contrast, is entirely original — so much so that it resembles a natural formation more than a piece of architecture, which is not bad. It must be something truly rare for Southeast Asia. Together with St. Paul’s Church, it’s something Malacca can truly be proud of. These two buildings, I believe, are all that remains of the Portuguese times in Malacca — and in Malaysia as well, since the Portuguese didn’t possess any other territories here.`,
