        subtitle: `It was built by the Dutch in 1650 as a governor's office. Later it served many other functions, and today it is a house of the History and Ethnography Museum.
It is promoted as the oldest remaining Dutch building in Southeast Asia — a claim that is actually not supported by historical evidence. It's only known that it was built shortly after Malacca was captured by the Dutch in 1641. It was built exactly where the Portuguese governor’s house used to be — destroyed during the Dutch victorious attack on Malacca. (The fighting was fierce.)
Stadthuys was an architectural copy of the town hall of Hoorn in the Netherlands.
The most interesting question for me is the color of the building. Why is Stadthuys, and all the surrounding buildings, painted in this awful red (or crimson, or brown) color? In Dutch times, Stadthuys was painted WHITE, and began to be painted red only under British rule around 1900. There are many versions of why it was done so, but I guess that was certainly not a question of beauty. The most plausible explanation is that white paint was expensive to maintain: the underlying brickwork is red, and after being uncovered by tropical rains, it all looked not very satisfactory. Switching to red paint just allowed it to be painted less often.
Today the concept of "Red Square" of Melakka is an important part of the local tourist industry, so I guess the question of color must be settled once and forever. Which is a little tragic - not only this brown hue is bad, bad also the lack of color variation basically ruins the view.

Because it's the only ruin in central Malacca that is explicitly open to the public and maintained by someone – meaning that someone keeps it relatively clean but without trying to make it look new. Which is a very good kind of maintenance, I think.

        I'm also curious about its preservation status: it's carefully excluded from UNESCO's "core" heritage area – the border is drawn precisely to include all the neighboring buildings but not this particular one. It must be some legal thing; I've no idea why it is so. But being outside this "core" area certainly makes it more likely for a building to be a ruin – and ruins are cool, so we shouldn't complain.

        Another thing that puzzles me is that this building has some free space around it – it's not directly connected to any other building, which in central Malacca must have been an extraordinary waste of land. I can't remember any other such examples, because even the richest houses here are squashed by the adjacent buildings.`

        title: `St Peter's Church`,
        subtitle: `It's the oldest functioning Roman Catholic church in Malaysia. It was built in 1710, shortly after certain historical events that ended the oppression suffered by Portuguese Catholics in Malacca. The oppression began in 1641, when Malacca fell to the Dutch (Calvinist Protestants), and lasted until 1703, when the Dutch formed an alliance with Portugal and decided to soften their treatment of Portuguese Catholics.
        However, some degree of discrimination remained, and this explains the remote location of this church — in its time, it must have been really far from Malacca proper. Today it's remote enough to be outside the UNESCO heritage area - not only the "core" heritage zone but even outside the extensive "buffer" zone. As a result, the surrounding area is open to modern large-scale development, and St. Peter’s is already dwarfed by nearby high-rise buildings.
        The architecture of this church is very much Portuguese - for instance, it has a lot in common with the 16th-century Church of Saint Francis in Kochi (Kerala, India), where Vasco de Gama was buried.
        In 2025 this building looks mostly great, freshly painted in white but still having a lot of historic roughness. The white color might seem a bit dull at first but I've come to appreciate it after seeing older versions on the Internet: some 20-30 years ago, St Pereter's was much more colorful, with different sections of the facade painted bright-green, and it looked truly horrible. Hopefully, creativity in this place is now banned forever.`,

A slightly earlier photograph from around '20s shows a building of about the same size but with simpler architecture — without a Dutch gable, without an arcade, and with much fewer windows - a simple but charismatic building, looking indeed very much like a post office. And of course, it wasn’t red (and perhaps none of the buildings of the Red Square were red).
        So I'm not sure if the reconstruction of 1930s made this structure more intersting, but it wasn't entirely catastrophic either. IF it was really carried out by the British, then it's quite admirable that they bothered to reproduce the style of their colonial predecessors. As an attempt to make the 'Red Square' more architecturally coherent, it was rather successful I think. Today's post building looks mostly organic in its context, even if not properly ancient.

        Porta is actually not entirely Portuguese, for it suffered some damage during the long and bloody siege of Melaka by the Dutch in 1641. Shortly after that it was renovated by the victors, and this explains the logo "ANNO 1670" inscribed on the gate's arch.
        
        Nevertheless, Porta looks extremely ancient, so much so that it resembles a natural formation more than a piece of architecture, which is not bad.
