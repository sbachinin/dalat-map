Most have sophisticated floor plans and are partly raised on decorative pillars.
        Today the bungalows are generally in good shape and constitute a part of idyllic landscape with carefully mowed lawns and lots of trees, etc. Though I believe these landscapes are not meant for general public. Today many of these building are probably occupied by some bodies of regional government.
        Around 2010, there was an interesting project of converting Bukit Peringgit to a museum area. This particular building became a museum of Macau, and another one housed museum of Cuba. The whole idea sounds pretty cool, but apparently it gained very little public attention, perhaps due to its remoteness from central Malacca, and after several years the museums were closed and became offices again.`

        subtitle: `It was built by the Dutch in 1650 as a governor's office. Later it served many other functions, and today it is a house of the History and Ethnography Museum.
        It is promoted as the oldest remaining Dutch building in Southeast Asia — a claim that is actually not supported by historical evidence. It's only known that it was built shortly after Malacca was captured by the Dutch in 1641. It was built exactly where the Portuguese governor’s house used to be — destroyed during the Dutch victorious attack on Malacca. (The fighting was fierce.)
        Stadthuys was an architectural copy of the town hall of Hoorn in the Netherlands.
        The most interesting question for me is the color of the building. Why is Stadthuys, and all the surrounding buildings, painted in this awful red (or crimson, or brown) color? In Dutch times, Stadthuys was painted WHITE, and began to be painted red only under British rule around 1900. There are many versions of why it was done so, but I guess that was certainly not a question of beauty. The most plausible explanation is that white paint was expensive to maintain: the underlying brickwork is red, and after being uncovered by tropical rains, it all looked not very satisfactory. Switching to red paint just allowed it to be painted less often.
        Today the concept of "Red Square" of Melakka is an important part of the local tourist industry, so I guess the question of color must be settled once and forever. Which is a little tragic - not only this brown hue is bad, bad also the lack of color variation basically ruins the view.

Because it's the only ruin in central Malacca that is explicitly open to the public and maintained by someone – meaning that someone keeps it relatively clean but without trying to make it look new. Which is a very good kind of maintenance, I think.

        I'm also curious about its preservation status: it's carefully excluded from UNESCO's "core" heritage area – the border is drawn precisely to include all the neighboring buildings but not this particular one. It must be some legal thing; I've no idea why it is so. But being outside this "core" area certainly makes it more likely for a building to be a ruin – and ruins are cool, so we shouldn't complain.

        Another thing that puzzles me is that this building has some free space around it – it's not directly connected to any other building, which in central Malacca must have been an extraordinary waste of land. I can't remember any other such examples, because even the richest houses here are squashed by the adjacent buildings.`

        subtitle: `It's the oldest functioning Roman Catholic church in Malaysia. It was built in 1710, shortly after certain historical events that ended the oppression suffered by Portuguese Catholics in Malacca. The oppression began in 1641, when Malacca fell to the Dutch (Calvinist Protestants), and lasted until 1703, when the Dutch formed an alliance with Portugal and decided to soften their treatment of Portuguese Catholics.
        However, some degree of discrimination remained, and this explains the remote location of this church — in its time, it must have been really far from Malacca proper. Today it's remote enough to be outside the UNESCO heritage area - not only the "core" heritage zone but even outside the extensive "buffer" zone. As a result, the surrounding area is open to modern large-scale development, and St. Peter’s is already dwarfed by nearby high-rise buildings.
        The architecture of this church is very much Portuguese - for instance, it has a lot in common with the 16th-century Church of Saint Francis in Kochi (Kerala, India), where Vasco de Gama was buried.
        In 2025 this building looks mostly great, freshly painted in white but still having a lot of historic roughness. The white color might seem a bit dull at first but I've come to appreciate it after seeing older versions on the Internet: some 20-30 years ago, St Pereter's was much more colorful, with different sections of the facade painted bright-green, and it looked truly horrible. Hopefully, creativity in this place is now banned forever.`,

        For most of its history, like most other buildings around, it was painted white; it became red only in the early 20th century.
        Over the years, several questionable architectural alterations have been made. The porch with three arches was added only in the mid-19th century, changing the façade quite dramatically.
        The ugly lettering "Christ Church" appeared much later, perhaps in the end of 20th century. I can understand why it was introduced: the church, and the red square at large, desperately needs some variation in color and some "focal points". So it's good to have something extra, and white, on the facade of the church. However, the actual intervention just wasn't done well: position of the letters and the "typeface" are totally wrong, to my taste.
        Despite all the abuse, Christ Church still looks cool - ancient and charismatic, even if a bit messy. I wish someone would find a better color for it - that would be such a gift to humanity.
        This church remains Anglican to this day, in a sense of being actually used by the local Anglican community. Services are said to be held every Sunday — a bit of a surprise to me, because from the outside the church gives the impression of a cold monument rather than a community space.
        The interior of the church is very unremarkable.`,

And of course, it wasn’t red (and perhaps none of the buildings of the Red Square were red).
        So I'm not sure if the reconstruction of 1930s made this structure more intersting, but it wasn't entirely catastrophic either. IF it was really carried out by the British, then it's quite admirable that they bothered to reproduce the style of their colonial predecessors. As an attempt to make the 'Red Square' more architecturally coherent, it was rather successful I think. Today's post building looks mostly organic in its context, even if not properly ancient.

        Porta is actually not entirely Portuguese, for it suffered some damage during the long and bloody siege of Melaka by the Dutch in 1641. Shortly after that it was renovated by the victors, and this explains the logo "ANNO 1670" inscribed on the gate's arch.

        A somewhat unconventional piece of architecture, with these onion-shaped domes, it might have looked interesting in earlier days. As of 2025, it's painted very badly in some bright and funny colors, making it difficult to enjoy the view.
        The area behind the club, known today as "Forbidden Garden of Melaka Sultanate", must have been the club's sporting grounds for most of the 20th century.
        As for the Club itself, it has a slightly longer history. It was formed in 1880, being the first European social club in Malacca (and was certainly quite exclusive). It still exists today and has two venues in Malacca where members are treated to various cultural and sporting events.`,

        It's worth saying thanks to the gallery, or whoever did the last paint job. As of 2025, the station has a very decent color.
        It shares many architectural similarities with the old fire station in George Town — though that one is substantially larger and not at all neglected, being considered an important tourist attraction. (Which isn’t necessarily a good thing.)`

        Note the use of laterite stone, exposed at ground floor level as a kind of decoration. Many of the important historic buildings in Malacca are built of laterite but it's almost always plastered over. The reason is apparently that it's not very durable, and in case of St Mary's the laterite stones are not in the best condition, having lots of plaster patches and beginning to look less than perfect (but not yet ruining the overall impression, as far as I can see).
        In the central Malacca laterite can be seen in [A Famosa](599113640) and [St Paul's church](170829535) - there it looks really good, however, it's difficult to say how expensive the maintenance is.
        There's also a laterite structure next to St Mary's, apparently built for Christian missionaries in the colonial times. It's a very simple and casual building but still laterite blocks make it look more interesting.
        St. Mary’s Church has experienced a visible revival over the past decade, undergoing restoration and gaining some public attention. Several years ago, it had a dreadful front porch appended to the original structure — but, miraculously, it was removed during the recent restoration - quite a triumph of common sense!`

It's the prettiest object in the area called Kampung Morten - which is meant to be an exemplary Malay village. It's one of the nearest traditional villages to the historic center of Malacca, and it also has an unusually high concentration of wooden houses - about 50 in a very compact area. Therefore it was made into a tourist destination, looking fake, with lots of funny banners and no life.
        Villa Sentosa in itself is not too bad - at least it allows one to understand the main principles of the Malay rural house: it is mostly a timber structure (without the use of nails, at least in theory), very spacious, raised on stilts, with a sophisticated floor plan composed of many specialized rooms, each looking (from outside) almost like a separate little building. Perhaps the only important feature that is lacking is the very steep gabled roof that can be seen in many other (much simpler) houses of Kampung Morten.
        Villa Sentosa overall is a decent place to visit, but it's certainly an extremely rich and polished version of the Malay house - the real traditional houses tend to be modest and casual, although often beautiful and full of character, often painted in jovial and fairly attractive colors. This kind of architecture is gradually disappearing but is still not difficult to find in almost any part of Malacca, with the exception of the historic center.
        Villa Sentosa reminds me of this wonderful [house](1421454302); at least it has the same kind of stilted veranda ("serambi").`

        For a long time — well into the British era — it was used as a powder magazine. I guess it was during this period that it stopped being plastered and painted white and became a kind of maintained ruin. Today, it remains a ruin, beautiful and open to the public free of charge.`,
