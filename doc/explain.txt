Why I decide against rendering text along linestrings (with curves, like for rivers)
	Because it's behaving wildly,
	Disappearing at various zoom levels, and it's impossible to control
	This is not the case when symbol (text) is drawn for a point.
	Behaviour of linestring is perhaps due to insufficient space,
		and this space is perhaps defined per-tile,
		and so the space is limited not by the whole linestring
			but by its portion in a certain tile.
			Very annoying





Features come from:
	OSM
	/static_data:
		bulk,
		custom_features,
	city_assets.renderables
		including dead_buildings

Tile layers come from
	city_assets.tile_layers
	"general_tile_layers":
		city bulk
		boring bldgs
	city_assets.renderables
		including dead_buildings


Style layers come from
	zoom_order -> drawing_layers (+ "selectable" variants made at runtime)
	"simple" layers defined in style.mjss
	city_assets.renderables
