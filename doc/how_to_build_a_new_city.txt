Add city bulk geometry
    just add city_bulk_geometry.mjs to city/static_data

Decide what osm buildings will be taken as "unimportant" (gray)
    set .unimportant_buildings_filter in city meta
    (filter out important buildings and perhaps some totally undesirable ones)

Create a tile layer that contains only some topical features from [OSM + custom]
    set .feature_filter in city_meta

Add features that don't come from OSM
    Add them to city/static_data/custom_features.geojson - they will be treated as regular OSM feature
    Can specify a dedicated tile_layer in city meta for such added features

Display city title (at early zoom)
    add city_title_coords to [city]/isomorphic_utils
    add [city_title] layer in [city]/zoom_order. (With maxzoom)


Add some singular city-specific features that are not from OSM
    (or from OSM but require some modifications maybe):
    Example: "cable car label" in Dalat.

    renderables.mjs at the root of city folder

    "Renderable" allows to describe a "singular" feature IN FULL IN ONE FILE:
    geometry + styling props
    
    Considering a potentially large number of such "singular" features,
    it can create a considerable mess, and will be harder to write for sure.
