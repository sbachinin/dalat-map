Add city bulk geometry
    just add city_bulk_geometry.mjs to city/static_data

Decide what osm buildings will be taken as "unimportant" (gray)
    add { name: "boring_building" } item to assets_for_build.tiling_config

Create a tile layer that contains only some topical features from [OSM + custom]
    set .osm_feature_filter in city_meta

Add features that don't come from OSM
    Add them to city/static_data/custom_features.geojson - they will be treated as regular OSM feature
    Can specify a dedicated tile_layer in city meta for such added features

Add dead_buildings
    put their geometries to city/static_data/custom_features_for_tiling/dead_buildings.mjs (this exact filename, I guess)
    reference these geometries by id in handmade data
        * is_dead prop in handmade data will do nothing
            (bldg is considered dead if it's in static.../dead_... file)

Display city title (at early zoom)
    add city_title_coords to [city]/isomorphic_utils
    add [city_title] layer in [city]/zoom_order. (With maxzoom)


Add some singular city-specific features that are not from OSM
    (or from OSM but require some modifications maybe):
    Example: "cable car label" in Dalat.

    renderables.mjs at the root of city folder

    "Renderable" allows to describe a "singular" feature IN FULL IN ONE FILE:
    geometry + styling props
    
    Considering a potentially large number of such "singular" features,
    it can create a considerable mess, and will be harder to write for sure.
