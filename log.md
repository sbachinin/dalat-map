CRITICAL
    desk-portrait: too low to show whole image

    rotated photo

    add "HL" heading with a medal icon

    1) make buildings linkable
    
    2) allow to back forward




    in details, a button to locate the bldg
    ??? open in google?


    
    panel after-drag animation: quick from start

    after linking imgs done:
        check missing pictures in the resulting meta obj, compare to files
        render all imgs, check broken, dupes and reorder
            render bldg id, img names, look in mobile

    restrict details height
    where else i reset panel scroll pos?
        can be broken

    ghost in mercure: needs a historical brother

GOOD TO HAVE
    look in pinterest
    open a building -> is it covered by panel -> shift map center
