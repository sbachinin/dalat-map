CRITICAL

    make sure details are no re-fetched

    test easing on mobile

    repetitive clicks:
        don't rerender;
        avoid fade out;
        not push to history

    fly to a position that respects the panel;
    fly on history / click / any_goto_details only when hidden by panel

    are buildings now conveniently linkable?
    
    rotated photo

    add "HL" heading with a medal icon

    should 2-col details be allowed on landsc?



    in details, a button to locate the bldg
    ??? open in google?

    user location
    
    panel after-drag animation: quick from start

    after linking imgs done:
        check missing pictures in the resulting meta obj, compare to files
        render all imgs, check broken, dupes and reorder
            render bldg id, img names, look in mobile

    restrict details height
    where else i reset panel scroll pos?
        can be broken
