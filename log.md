CRITICAL
    Had to remote-debug by serving from winodws
        therefore:
            develop in windows;
            some commands run on linux 
                and cp results via git
                    copying via terminal breaks crlf:
                        cp -r js /mnt/c/Users/Admin/projects/dalat-map



how heavy are centroids?

does it make sense to store centroids FOR BUILDINGS WITHOUT PHOTOS?

so centroids should be generated from dead file too

    seems that building tap causes touchend and then panel.setSize

    if panel is closed
        & you click on an already selected bldg,
        panel must expand

    any reason for different easing for panel expand and for easeTo?

    check freeze after many popstate (served from gh)



    are buildings now conveniently linkable?

    disable map rotation?
        (i guess it won't play well with map limits
        + can be problems with offset)

    is ml version fixed?



    
    rotated photo

    add "HL" heading with a medal icon

    should 2-col details be allowed on landsc?



    in details, a button to locate the bldg
    ??? open in google?

    user location
    
    panel after-drag animation: quick from start

    after linking imgs done:
        check missing pictures in the resulting meta obj, compare to files
        render all imgs, check broken, dupes and reorder
            render bldg id, img names, look in mobile

    restrict details height
    where else i reset panel scroll pos?
        can be broken

GOOD TO HAVE
    look in pinterest
    open a building -> is it covered by panel -> shift map center
