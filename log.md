CRITICAL
    move dead buildings json to data place
    
    separate generated data from plain


    add that another dead bldg

    make bldgs linkable
    

    after linking imgs done:
        check missing pictures in the resulting meta obj, compare to files
        render all imgs, check broken, dupes and reorder
            render bldg id, img names, look in mobile

    restrict details height
    where else i reset panel scroll pos?
        can be broken
